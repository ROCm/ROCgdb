AMD ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb)
==========================

Introduction
------------

The AMD ROCm Debugger (ROCgdb) is the AMD source-level debugger for Linux,
based on the GNU Debugger (GDB).  It enables heterogeneous debugging on the AMD
ROCm platform comprising of an x86-based host architecture along with
commercially available AMD GPU architectures supported by the AMD Debugger API
Library (ROCdbgapi).  The AMD Debugger API Library (ROCdbgapi) is included with
the AMD ROCm release.

For more information about AMD ROCm, see:

- https://docs.amd.com/

You can use the standard GDB commands for both CPU and GPU code debugging.  For
more information about ROCgdb, refer to the *ROCgdb User Guide* which is
installed at:

- ``/opt/rocm/share/info/rocgdb/gdb.info`` as a texinfo file
- ``/opt/rocm/share/doc/rocgdb/rocgdb.pdf`` as a PDF file

You can refer to the following chapters in the *ROCgdb User Guide* for more
specific information about debugging heterogeneous programs on AMD ROCm:

- *Debugging Heterogeneous Programs* provides general information about
  debugging heterogeneous programs.  It presents features and commands that are
  not currently implemented but provisionally planned for future versions.
- *Configuration-Specific Information > Architectures > AMD GPU* provides
  specific information about debugging heterogeneous programs on AMD ROCm with
  supported AMD GPU chips.  This section also lists the implementation status
  and known issues of the current version.

For more information about the GNU Debugger (GDB), refer to the ``README`` file
in this folder or check the GNU Debugger (GDB) web site at:

Build the AMD ROCm Debugger
---------------------------

ROCgdb can be built on Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, Centos 8.1, RHEL 8.1, RHEL
9.1 and SLES 15 Service Pack 1.

Building ROCgdb has the following prerequisites:

1. A C++11 compiler such as GCC 4.8 or Clang 3.3.

2. AMD Debugger API Library (ROCdbgapi) which can be installed as part of the
   AMD ROCm release by the ``rocm-dbgapi`` package.

3. For Ubuntu 20.04 and Ubuntu 22.04 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   apt install bison flex gcc make ncurses-dev texinfo g++ zlib1g-dev \
     libexpat-dev python3-dev liblzma-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev \
     libbabeltrace-dev libbabeltrace-ctf-dev
   ````

4. For CentOS 8.1, RHEL 8.1 and RHEL 9.1 the following adds the needed
   packages:

   ````shell
   yum install -y epel-release centos-release-scl bison flex gcc make \
     texinfo texinfo-tex gcc-c++ zlib-devel expat-devel python3-devel \
     xz-devel gmp-devel mpfr-devel libbabeltrace-devel ncurses-devel
   wget http://repo.okay.com.mx/centos/8/x86_64/release/libbabeltrace-devel-1.5.4-2.el8.x86_64.rpm \
   && rpm -ivh --nodeps libbabeltrace-devel-1.5.4-2.el8.x86_64.rpm
   ````

5. For SLES 15 Service Pack 1 the following adds the needed packages:

   ````shell
   zypper in bison flex gcc make texinfo gcc-c++ zlib-devel libexpat-devel \
     python3-devel xz-devel gmp-devel mpfr-devel babeltrace-devel ncurses-devel
   ````

An example command-line to build ROCgdb on Linux is:

````shell
cd rocgdb
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --program-prefix=roc \
  --enable-64-bit-bfd --enable-targets="x86_64-linux-gnu,amdgcn-amd-amdhsa" \
  --disable-ld --disable-gas --disable-gdbserver --disable-sim --enable-tui \
  --disable-gdbtk --disable-gprofng --disable-shared --with-expat \
  --with-system-zlib --without-guile --with-babeltrace --with-lzma \
  --with-python=python3
make
````

If the AMD Debugger API Library (ROCdbgapi) is not installed in the system
default location, specify ``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` so ``pkg-config` can gather the
correct build configuration.  If ROCdbgapi is installed in
``/opt/rocm-$ROCM_VERSION`` (the default for ROCm packages), use
``PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/rocm-$ROCM_VERSION/share/pkgconfig``.

If the system's dynamic linker is not configured to locate ROCdbgapi where it is
installed, ROCgdb can be configured and built using
``LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=/opt/rocm-$ROCM_VERSION/lib"``.  Alternatively,
``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` can be used at runtime to indicate where ROCdbgapi is
installed.

The built ROCgdb executable will be placed in:

- ``build/gdb/gdb``

The texinfo *User Manual* will be placed in:

- ``build/gdb/doc/gdb.info``

To install ROCgdb:

````shell
make install
````

The installed ROCgdb will be placed in:

- ``<prefix>/bin/rocgdb``

To execute ROCgdb, the ROCdbgapi library and its dependent ROCcomgr library must
be installed.  These can be installed as part of the AMD ROCm release by the
``rocm-dbgapi`` package:

- ``librocm-dbgapi.so.0``
- ``libamd_comgr.so.1``

The PDF *User Manual* can be generated with:

````shell
make pdf
````

The generated PDF will be placed in:

- ``build/gdb/doc/gdb.pdf``
