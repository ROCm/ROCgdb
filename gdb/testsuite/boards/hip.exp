# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite
# against C/C++ device code compiled with hipcc.
#
# Example usage:
#  bash$ make check RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=hip'

# Running tests against the GPU device is accomplished with linking
# lib/hip/hip-driver.cc into every testcase.  That file contains both
# the host's main() entry point, and a kernel entry point.  The kernel
# calls the testcase's main, in GPU context.
#
# Then the board overrides gdb_compile to compile the C/C++ testcase
# files targeting the device, and link in the driver.
#
# Ideally we would not have to modify any of the testcases sources.
# Unfortunately that isn't possible, but we can avoid a number of
# classes of changes, effectively reducing required absolute changes
# significantly.
#
# For example, to force the compiler to emit __device__ functions
# without sprinkling __device__ all over the place in all functions in
# all testcases, we use:
#
#  #pragma clang force_cuda_host_device begin
#
# And to force the compiler to emit __device__ globals, we use:
#
#  #pragma clang attribute (__device__, apply_to = variable (is_global))
#
# The board file tweaks the compilation routine to inject that in
# translation units by compiling a wrapper hip-test-wrapper.cc instead
# of the desired file.  The wrapper file does the magic mentioned
# above and includes the file we wanted to compile.
#
# The hip-test-wrapper.cc file is also responsible for renaming the
# testcase's main function, so that it doesn't conflict with the
# host's main:
#
#  #define main gdb_hip_test_main
#
# The testsuite, for each testcase, normally compiles the test
# program, and then runs it to main (like "b main; run").  Because we
# rename the device/testcase "main" function, "b main" sets a
# breakpoint on the host "main" function, not the testcase's entry
# point.  That is addressed by having GDB itself rename the
# "gdb_hip_test_main" function at symbol read time, pretending that
# it's really called "main".  The host "main" function is also renamed
# to get it out of the way.
#
# Parallel mode testing is supported by making use of the file locking
# implemented in lib/rocm.exp and also used by the gdb.rocm/
# testcases.  That means that only one GDB at a time runs, but, most
# compilations run in parallel, which still provides a speed
# improvement, since compiling for the GPU is slow.
#
# Note that HIP is C++ based, so we're running all C testcases in C++
# mode.  E.g., most gdb.base/ testcases.
#
# The multi-threading testcases are disabled. The device kernel runs a
# single work-item.
