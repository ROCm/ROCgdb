The GNU linker contains CRC routines that are used to implement the
DIGEST CRC32/64 commands in the output section.

The CRC routines are extracted from LIBCRC available at
* https://www.libcrc.org/
* https://github.com/lammertb/libcrc/tree/v2.0

NOTE: The user could/(should) extract the CRC calculation routines
      and add to their program.
      The linker can add the table, but not the calculation routines.
